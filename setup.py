    Parse a file path containing a pip-tools requirements.in and return a list of requirements.

    Will properly follow ``-r`` and ``-c`` links like ``pip-tools``. This
    means layered requirements will be returned as one list.

    Other ``pip-tools`` and ``pip``-specific lines are excluded.

    Args:
        filepath (Path): The path to the requirements file
        visited (set, optional): A set of paths that have already been visited.

    Returns:
